        2. I am interested in website design and am taking this class to see if I enjoy HCI.

        6. https://grette.no/en/  I really enjoy this simplistic website that showcases the members of Northwestern Law. It shows everyone clearly with a simple design, but also very attractive colors.

        7. https://www.etq-amsterdam.com/  This website does a great job with effective communication. It allows for the user to immediately see a large picture of a shoe, which is what the website is selling.

        8. https://www.amazon.com/  Though it might be a werid choice, I believe that the Amazon website is very effective in what it does. It is simple enough for elders to use frequently and also complex enough for people to scroll through for hours.
