            About Bossam
        </div>
        <p2>
            &nbsp;<br>
            Bossam, also known as Korean boiled pork belly, is a staple Korean food that is served with side dishes. <br>
            Origins: Bossam originates from the Jolla-Do area of Korea and has origins in more noble classes of Korean history and is one a few dishes that's culinary origins are believed to stretch back to the Joseon era. This dish does take about an hour to prepare, but it is certainly worth the time. <br>

            The main ingredients needed for Bossam are pork belly (3-inch wide cut of about 2.5 pounds), fermented soybean paste (1.5 tablespoons), and coffee powder (1 teaspoon). <br>

                <li>1 teaspoon of salt </li>
                <li>enough water or beer to fully cover pork belly</li>
                <li>1 inch ginger sliced </li>
                <li>1 teaspoon of pepper</li>
                <li>1 onion</li>
                <li>4 large scallions</li>

            How to make (takes 1 hour)

        <p2>
            &nbsp;<br>
            Now that all the ingredients are gathered, it is simple to make. This makes enough for 4 people. <br>
            <ul>
                <li>In a large pot, place the 2 whole pork belly slices and cover with water or beer until fully submerged.</li>
                &nbsp;<br>
                <li>Add 1 tablespoons of salt and pepper along with 2 tablespoons of fermented soybean paste and then mix until the paste has completely dissolved. </li>
                &nbsp;<br>
                <li>Slice a whole onion into quarters and then place into the pot along with the ginger slices.</li>
                &nbsp;<br>
                <li>Cut the large scalions in half and add the white parts into the pot along with 6 garlic cloves.</li>
                &nbsp;<br>
                <li>Add one teaspoon of coffee powder and two bayleaves. </li>
                <center>
                    <img class="third" src="bossam copy.jpeg" width="800" height ="500" >
                    <br> 
                    <p>
                        The pot should look like this image with all the ingredients added.

                </center>

                <li>Bring to a boil and then change the heat to medium and put a lid on it for 45 minutes. </li>
                &nbsp;<br>
                <li>Check if the pork is fork tender and then slice thinly and enjoy. </li>
                &nbsp;<br>
                <li>With leftovers, the pork can be sealed and refrigerated for up to a week. </li>
                &nbsp;<br>
                <li>To reheat, simply microwave for 30 seconds or heat on a pan. </li>
            </ul>

            <a href="https://www.koreanbapsang.com/bossam-boiled-pork-wraps/"  target= "_blank"> Korean Bapsang</a> is the first website that I looked at to examine the cooking process of bossam. I enjoyed how this website had clear instructions and the three step process to enjoy bossam made it easy to understand. One thing I did not like about the wbesite was that there was too much going on for a recipe page. <br>
            <a href="https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/bo-ssam"  target= "_blank"> Maangchi</a> is a great website that provides thorough instructions about how to make bossam, but I feel like sometimes that might be a larger con than a pro. The process of boiling pork belly with seasonings is simple and does not need pages of instructions. <br>
            The <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/12197-momofukus-bo-ssam"  target= "_blank"> New York Times</a> provides a modern twist to the generational dish by adding more creative twists like sous vide and oven cooking. Though modern twists are interesting, the traditional dish should be preserved for those who want to try the auntenthic version.
